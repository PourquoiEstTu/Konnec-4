# Konnec-4
A game similar to Connect 4 using the Dollar and Euro symbols as pieces.
The game will immediately load a board into the command line once you run the file. 
To play, enter which column (a number between 1 and 7) you want to put the piece in, and the rest is just like a real game of Connect 4!
The top row of the board is misaligned from the rest, but that doesn't affect the gameplay.
